# SICHELIA: Sicilian Intangible Cultural Heritage Exploration Leveraging Innovative Accessibility

SICHELIA is a project aimed at enhancing and enabling interoperability of Sicilian Intangile Cultural Heritage (ICH) open data through conversion, semantic enrichment, and transformation into NGSI-LD format, the standard for representing entities in the context of Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.

## Project Objectives

- Retrieval and conversion of Open Data published on the Open Data portal of the Sicilian Regional Government.
- Semantic enrichment of datasets with additional metadata (e.g., geographic coordinates, related cultural entities, semantic categories).
- Linking (Linked Data) to external sources such as DBpedia, Wikidata, and domain ontologies.
- Transformation into NGSI-LD to support intelligent and interoperable applications in the smart city amd smart tourism domain.

## Web Application

SICHELIA is a web application designed to explore and promote Sicily’s ICH. Through an interactive map, advanced search tools and thematic filtering features, it allows users to discover traditions, places, and cultural events distributed across the Sicilian territory.
