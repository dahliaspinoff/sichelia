# Survey

This repository contains the materials linked to the survey used to evaluate the web application SICHELIA.

# Methodology

The usability test was conducted through an anonymous online questionnaire administered to groups of real users. Participants tested the web app in two contexts:

- Controlled environment: supervised sessions to directly observe user interaction.
- Uncontrolled environment: independent use of the application.

After the testing phase, users completed the survey.

# Survey Structure

The questionnaire collected both:

- Quantitative data through Likert-scale questions (e.g. satisfaction, ease of use, clarity, efficiency).
- Qualitative data through open-ended questions (e.g. suggestions, comments, reported issues).

# Design References

The survey was designed following established usability evaluation models and inspired by:
- Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS) (Harper & Norman, 1993)
- USE Questionnaire (Lund, 2001)
- Website Analysis and Measurement Inventory (WAMMI) https://www.wammi.com/questionnaire.html
